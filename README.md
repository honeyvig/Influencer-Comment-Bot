------
Here’s a high-level Python code structure to implement the Influencer Comment Bot project, leveraging FastAPI, Langchain, Pinecone, and OpenAI GPT-4. This code will cover key aspects such as setting up FastAPI, integrating Langchain for conversational flow, using Pinecone for storing embeddings, and connecting to GPT-4 for generating product reviews.
Step 1: Set Up Your FastAPI Backend

    Install required libraries:

    pip install fastapi uvicorn openai langchain pinecone-client

    Create a FastAPI application with endpoints to interact with the AI components:

from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel
import openai
import langchain
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
import pinecone

# Initialize FastAPI
app = FastAPI()

# Initialize OpenAI API
openai.api_key = "your-openai-api-key"

# Initialize Pinecone (ensure you've set up your Pinecone environment)
pinecone.init(api_key="your-pinecone-api-key", environment="us-west1-gcp")

# Initialize Pinecone index (ensure it's created beforehand)
index = pinecone.Index("reviews-index")

# Create a schema for the product reviews API request
class ReviewRequest(BaseModel):
    product_id: str
    influencer_name: str
    product_description: str
    previous_reviews: list

# Initialize Langchain conversation
template = """
You are an influencer reviewing a product. You need to write an engaging and unique review for the product described. 
Here is the product description: {product_description}. 
Previous reviews: {previous_reviews}
Please write a detailed review based on the above information. Be creative and genuine.
"""

# Create Langchain prompt and chain
prompt = PromptTemplate(input_variables=["product_description", "previous_reviews"], template=template)
chain = ConversationChain(prompt=prompt)

@app.post("/generate_review/")
async def generate_review(review_request: ReviewRequest):
    # 1. Fetch product and review data
    product_id = review_request.product_id
    influencer_name = review_request.influencer_name
    product_description = review_request.product_description
    previous_reviews = review_request.previous_reviews
    
    # 2. Use Langchain to generate review
    generated_review = chain.run(product_description=product_description, previous_reviews="\n".join(previous_reviews))
    
    # 3. Store the generated review embedding in Pinecone (for uniqueness)
    # Create an embedding using OpenAI GPT-4
    embedding_response = openai.Embedding.create(
        input=generated_review,
        model="text-embedding-ada-002"
    )
    review_embedding = embedding_response['data'][0]['embedding']
    
    # Store the embedding in Pinecone
    index.upsert([(product_id, review_embedding, {"influencer_name": influencer_name, "review": generated_review})])
    
    return {"review": generated_review}

# Start FastAPI app using Uvicorn (run in terminal)
# uvicorn main:app --reload

Step 2: Explanation of the Code

    FastAPI: The web framework for creating the backend API. It defines an endpoint (/generate_review/) where the influencer can request a new product review.
    Pydantic Model (ReviewRequest): This defines the data model for the request body, where the influencer provides the product ID, name, description, and previous reviews.
    Langchain: It handles the conversation flow for generating product reviews. The prompt is structured to provide context (product description, previous reviews) and generate a review based on this.
    Pinecone: It stores embeddings of generated reviews to ensure uniqueness. The embedding of the generated review is compared to previously stored embeddings to avoid duplicate content.
    OpenAI GPT-4: Used for generating both the review and embeddings to store in Pinecone.

Step 3: Running the Backend

To run the FastAPI app, save the code to a file (e.g., main.py) and run the following command:

uvicorn main:app --reload

This will start a development server where you can test the API.
Step 4: Frontend (Basic Example Using Next.js)

While this code is primarily for the backend, you will need a frontend to interact with it. You can set up a basic Next.js frontend to call the API:

npx create-next-app@latest
cd your-project
npm install axios

Create an api/submitReview.js file in pages to interact with the FastAPI backend.

import axios from "axios";

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  if (req.method === "POST") {
    const { product_id, influencer_name, product_description, previous_reviews } = req.body;

    try {
      const response = await axios.post("http://localhost:8000/generate_review/", {
        product_id,
        influencer_name,
        product_description,
        previous_reviews,
      });
      
      res.status(200).json({ review: response.data.review });
    } catch (error) {
      res.status(500).json({ error: "Error generating review" });
    }
  } else {
    res.status(405).json({ error: "Method not allowed" });
  }
}

Now, you can integrate the frontend with input fields for influencers to enter product details and retrieve generated reviews from the backend.
Step 5: Testing the Integration

    Test the FastAPI backend by sending a POST request to /generate_review/ with product details and previous reviews.
    Ensure the generated review is stored in Pinecone and can be accessed or compared to avoid duplications.

Step 6: Deployment

    Frontend (Next.js): Deploy your frontend on platforms like Vercel.
    Backend (FastAPI): Deploy the backend on Heroku, AWS, or GCP.
    Pinecone: Ensure the Pinecone index is set up and scaled for your needs.

Conclusion

This code provides the backend infrastructure for an influencer review generation bot, using Langchain for prompt-based review generation, Pinecone for managing review uniqueness, and GPT-4 for natural language processing. The project can be extended with features such as:

    More complex product categorization.
    Integration of additional AI models for sentiment analysis.
    Advanced frontend with richer user experiences.

You can customize the code further to match your exact requirements
